        <p>The company is owned by Chandubhai Virani. Chandubhai and his brothers Bhikhubhai and Kanubhai migrated from
            a small Village Dhun Dhoraji, Kalavad Taluka, Jamnagar district of Gujarat. Their father Popatbhai Virani
            was a farmer, who sold ancestral agriculture land and gave ₹20,000 (US$250) to them to venture into
            business.[citation needed]

            The Viranis invested in farm equipment but could not succeed and lost the money. Kakubhai and his brothers
            started a wafer business from a canteen of a astron cinema hall in Rajkot in 1974. Until 1989, the wafers
            were produced at the Viranis' house and distributed in and around Rajkot city.</p>

            In the initial stage, Balaji Wafers set up their plant at Aji Vasad (Industrial Zone, Rajkot) with a new
            concept of making potato chips. The main benefit they got is the readymade infrastructure availability due
            to which their cost was reduced to a large extent. They operated there for around 22 years.[citation needed]

            Balaji Wafers then set up a fully automatic plant near Metoda G.I.D.C. which is in the area of the village
            Vajdi, outside the town of Rajkot.
